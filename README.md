## Assignments

The following tasks are meant to evaluate your familiarity with JavaScript libraries that belong to [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/).
Please complete them using Turbo or Stimulus (or both). You are free to use any version (current or beta).

Once you are done with an assignment, create a `git commit` with your code changes and use the commit message
to communicate anything you deem important (what choices you made, why you went a certain route, and so on).
If possible, have a separate commit for each assignment.

Once you are done with the code changes, create a ZIP file of your repository and send it back to us. Thanks!

### Assignment #1: let users create appointments without a full page reload

Currently users create appointments by selecting a future date and clicking on "Create Appointment".
`AppointmentsController#create` stores the new appointment in the database and redirects the user to the main page where appointments are displayed.

https://github.com/HouseAccountEng/turbo_schedule/blob/88fb12742092fd0d60cebb0dba6feb3b2bb7e377/app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb#L12-L13

This flow works correctly but is slow: the full page (including its assets) is reloaded at every submission.
Your first assignment is to keep the same flow while avoiding a full page reload.
When an appointment is created, it should be added to the DOM without modifying the rest of the page.

You can verify that the page doesn't fully reload by looking at the `<title>` of the page. 
The number in parenthesis (53238 in the image above) is the timestamp of when the page is loaded and shouldn't change after the form submission.

There are also tests that you can run with `rspec` that should pass before and after your code changes.

### Assignment #2: let users cancel appointments without a full page reload

Currently users cancel appointments by selecting an appointment and clicking on "Destroy this appointment".

![cancel](https://github.com/HouseAccountEng/turbo_schedule/assets/10076/1a6e85f0-5b96-43b2-bfe2-50da7666b949)

`AppointmentsController#destroy` removes the appointment from the database and redirects the user to the main page.

https://github.com/HouseAccountEng/turbo_schedule/blob/88fb12742092fd0d60cebb0dba6feb3b2bb7e377/app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb#L21-L22

This flow works but, once again, is slow: the full page is reloaded.
Your second assignment is to remove the canceled appointment from the DOM without modifying the rest of the page.

### Assignment #3: prevent users from picking invalid dates

Appointments can only be created for dates in the future that do not already have appointments.

https://github.com/HouseAccountEng/turbo_schedule/blob/88fb12742092fd0d60cebb0dba6feb3b2bb7e377/app/models/appointment.rb#L3-L4

The current interface doesn't give any indication of this rule, therefore it's easy for users to pick an invalid date.

Your third assignment is to ensure as much as possible that users can only pick valid dates from the calendar.
In order to do this, you are free to use any third-party calendar library. Users should be able to select only valid dates.

Here's something to consider. While the user is on the page, someone else might book an appointment on a future date.
Then, all of a sudden, that date will not be available anymore. 
If possible, your calendar should reflect this: as soon as any user picks a date, that date becomes unavailable for all other users (without needing to reload the page).
